# Diabetes-Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning-based diabetes prediction model using scikit-learn's built-in load_diabetes dataset. The model utilizes ensemble techniques such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting to predict diabetes progression. Key evaluation metrics, including accuracy and error, are calculated and cross-validated using RandomizedSearchCV.

## Features
### Implementation of multiple ensemble techniques:
Random Forest
Decision Tree
Gradient Boosting

Cross-validation using RandomizedSearchCV.

### Performance metrics such as:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
RÂ² Score
